# 3rd Generation Moving Average

3rd generation moving average is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is an attempt to improve of the classic exponential moving average indicator.

It implements M. Duerschner's method and reduces time lag significantly.

The indicator displays similarly to traditional moving averages - in the main window of the chart.

It can be used for fast/slow MA crossover analysis like any other type of moving average.
